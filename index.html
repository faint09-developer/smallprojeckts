        <p>"In the end" is a song by the band Linkin Park.
             The way i hear it and the way i interpretate, 
             might be different from so many others,
            and what it means to me too.</p>

        <h2><em>"Time is a valuable thing</em>"</h2>

        <p>"time is a valuable thing, watch it fly by as the pendulum swings"
            this part of the song tells me we should value time because it passes so fast
            as the clock goes by.
            "watch it count down to the end of the day the clock ticks life away
            it's so unreal"
            this part i feel like, you keep watching as time continues to go on
            no matter what, and when you realize, the day is almost over.
            and the more the time passes the less time you have and the clock
            is the one deciding that, as it marks up the time.
            at one point, one thing is in a certain way, and sudenly,
            it's just not anymore which seems unbeliaveble.

        <h2><em>"I tried so hard and got so far, but in the end,
            it doesn't even matter"</em>
        </h2>
        <p>what i feel about this part is: the person's really given her best 
           to accomplish something and she managed to go really far, but 
           as things happen and pass and all stays behind and never
           comes back, it doesn't even matter because it's insignificant anyway.
